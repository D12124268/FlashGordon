PDG Canyon Terrain Bonus Pack
-----------------------------

Overview:
This asset contains additional textures for your PDG Canyon Terrain asset.


Detail Textures
---------------
One example set of four different, tiling textures, see folder "Detail Textures"
They are intended to work as detailed ground-cover and could be painted on the terrain
manually or automatically (via splatmaps)


Splatmaps
---------
The "Splatmaps" folder contains 10 splatmaps, matching the topology of the canyon terrains.
They can be used to automatically control the distribution of detail textures.
The orientation of the splatmaps matches the orientation of the meshes/terrains you
can create from the .raw files of the main asset!

Detail textures are intended to be assigned in a specific order:
 
R=Higher areas=D1_ground/ground_height
G=flat areas=D2_crackle/crackle_height
B=steep areas=D3_rock/rock_height
A=”flow” areas=D4_pebbel/pebble_height
(see PDG Canyon Skyshop settings.jpg “detail texture order” for an illustration)

If you are using Skyshop Terrain Shader, there is a basic shader-setup to work and
Experiment with, see “PDG Canyon Skyshop settings.jpg” for details.



Diffuse Textures
----------------
The diffuse textures in this package got no Ambient Occlusion "baked" into their RGB channels
, instead the AO was put into the Alpha Channel. This textures are best to
use with the Marmoset Skyshop Terrain Shader, but can also be used with standard
unity shaders. Just give them a try and see, which suits you best!
